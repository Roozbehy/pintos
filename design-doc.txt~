               ARGUMENT PASSING
               ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.



---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?



---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

strtok_r() returns a pointer and strtok() doesn't.

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

In thread.h:
  //return status
  int ret;

  //true iff it has been waited before
  bool already_waited; 

  //determines if the execution success or not
  bool success; 

  //semaphore for process_wait()
  struct semaphore wait; 

  //semaphore for process_execute()
  struct semaphore load_wait; 

  //list of its child processes
  struct list child_list; 

  //list_elem for child_list
  struct list_elem child_elem;

  //list of files that is opened by the process
  struct list opened_files; 

  //parent process of this process
  struct thread *parent; 

  //executable file on the disk
  struct file *image_on_disk; 

  //Helper functions for task 2.
  //Get thread from its tid
  struct thread *
  get_thread(tid_t tid);

  //get thread from the provided list and a tid.
  //used to get a child thread from a child_list
  struct thread *
  get_child_thread(struct list *l, tid_t tid);

In syscall.c:
  We added all the syscalls that is in the spec: sys_exit, sys_write etc. Total of 13

  //handler for syscall
  static handler syscall_vec[SYSCALL_NUM];
  //locks
  static struct lock lock;
  static struct lock fid_lock;
  //file list 
  static struct list files;

  //find a file by its fd from the file_list of a process
  static struct file *
  find_file(int fd)

  //Returns a fid to use for a new file
  //starting from 2 (0 and 1 taken by IO)
  static int
  allocate_fid(void)

  //Check validity of a pointer, address etc
  static bool
  valid_pointer(const void *vaddr)

In syscall.h:
  //This struct represent an elem for a file, which will be used in creating a file list
  //for a process
  //Contains the file ptr, a file descriptor, its list_elem and its thread elem
  struct fd_elem
  {
    int fd;
    struct file *file;
    struct list_elem elem;
    struct list_elem thread_elem;
  };

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

When a file is opened, its pointer and id will be saved to a struct fd_elem.
After a process is finished, its files will be closed hence the fd will be freed.
When another process opened another file, the same file id may be granted to that file.
So file descriptor is not unique within the entire OS, just within a single process

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.



>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data
>> to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least
>> and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table
>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about
>> for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there room

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.



>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address
>> can fail due to a bad pointer value.  Such accesses must cause the
>> process to be terminated.  System calls are fraught with such
>> accesses, e.g. a "write" system call requires reading the system

>> arguments, then an arbitrary amount of user memory, and any of
>> these can fail at any point.  This poses a design and
>> error-handling problem: how do you best avoid obscuring the primary
>> function of code in a morass of error-handling?  Furthermore, when
>> an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily
>> allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?  In a few
>> paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for
>> managing these issues.  Give an example.



---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?



>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?



---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?



>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?



>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?



               SURVEY QUESTIONS
               ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
